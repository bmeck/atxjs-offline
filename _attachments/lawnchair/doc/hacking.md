Building `Lawnchair` is easy. The `MakeFile` has everything you need to wire out a quick build. Have a poke around the source to get a feel for how the project is structured. 

    /
	|-doc/ .............. project documentation 
    |-lib/ .............. generated release ready src ends up here
    |-src

    | |-plugins ........ additional functionality for typical persistence solutions
    | '-lawnchair.js ... base implementation
    |-test/ 
    |-util/ ............ support files for builds
    |-LICENSE
    |-Makefile ......... builds releases
